            I created this website to show my support to the skate community mainly here in Laguna.<br /><br />Recently, I got injured and
		fractured my shin bone or whatever they call it and they cast almost my whole right leg. I'm currently unable to walk
		without my crutches and my doctor advised me not to move my right leg too much. I can still skate though, but only 
		after a year for my bone to completely heal. And since I can't skate much these days (pun intended), I figured why not
		make a website right? So here you are visiting this stupid ass website.<br /><br />I currently don't have future plans
		for what I will be posting on this website and what materials and content I will be posting here but this website will 
		mostly focus on skate vids, images, ideas, insight and other stuff relating to skateboarding.
